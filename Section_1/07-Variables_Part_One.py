                                                    # Lesson -7-#
                                                    # Variables #


# In this lesson we'll discuss:
    # Naming Convesion "Rules"
    # Syntax
      # Declariation
      # Initialization "Assingment"
    # Operations on variables



# What is var?
    
    # var is portion of memory location that addressed by human language "identifier"
    # var is is just like a container "label" 
    # var is a nick name for some memory location
# python is dynamicaly type language:
    # means you can exchang "ressing to other data type" value of a var during runtime
    # that because python is smart enough to detect type of var from it's value "content"
      # and that happened during assignemt  
    # runttime:
      # is the time that taken by  program to be executed and produce output 
# Naming rules of var:
  # when you dealing with var you should aware of :
    #[1]- you can start with Alphabet [A-Z , a-z]
    #[2]- must not be one of the python keyword "reseirved word"
    #[3]- python is casesensitive 
    #[4]- var name should not include special chars { @, # , ! , % ...}
    #[5]- var name should be meaningful
    #[6]- You can use camel case , under score in case var name is too long 

# Let's see that in practice
# declariation of a var:
  # Salary 
# Declariation and initialization
Salary = 500                                               
print(Salary)

# Some Operations on var:
# we can perfore all math expressions if var is numircal type
print(Salary-50)
print(Salary+50)
print(Salary*50)
print(Salary/50)

name = "John Kron"
print(name*3)  # Only in python you can multiply String
# Some naming convesion:

name = "Ibrahim"        # valid 
print(name)
fullName = "John Kron"  # Camel Case also valid
print(fullName)
# $Salary = 700
# print($Salary)
Adderss_of_city = "USA - New Jercy - Eienctien St "  # valid 
print(Adderss_of_city)
# &Salary = 444                   # not Valid
# print(&Salary)
# in = input("Enter your name:")  # not valid will generate an error cuz in is a keyword
# print(in)   # error
