# what is comment?
  
  # Comment is unreadable code or text 
  # compiler do not see it "not comile it"
  # Is a docmentation for programmer 
#In python we use hash sign "#" to perform comment 
# Comment should be useful "don't use comment every wherr"
# Comment should be meaningful  "realy describes the immbigutiy" 
# Example for comment :

# meaningful comment:
adult = 20
 
if adult <= 20:    # must be greater thatn 20 to awarding bonus
  print("Elegable")
else:
  print("not Elegable")


# un-necessary comment:
num1 = 30
num2 = 20
total = num2 + num1 

print(total)  # printing total
