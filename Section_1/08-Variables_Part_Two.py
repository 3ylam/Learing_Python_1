# Some Terms:
  #[1]- Source code:

      # Original code written in programming language "sudo code"
  #[2]- Compilatiom"
      # in this stage compiler do the following things:
        # [i]-   checking of there is any error in code
        # [ii]-  linking , inculding libraries if needed
        # [iii]- if there is no errory then program is ready to be executed   
  #[3]- Translation "Execution" :
      # Is a stage comes after compilaion steps.
      # in this phase Correct sudo code "compilation code" , "object code" runs and produce output
  #[4]- Runtime:
      # Is the time that taken by program to be executed and produce desireable outpute
 #[5]- Interpreted Langauge:
      #   



# Dynamicaly type in  action:
# suppose:
encrypted_message = "go-454-$$$-so good-3300"  # string value
print(encrypted_message)
encrypted_message = 4359929594396922422        # same var but assinged numircal vale
print(encrypted_message)
encrypted_message = True                       # same var with boolean type value
print(encrypted_message)
encrypted_message = 'A'                        # char
print(encrypted_message)
