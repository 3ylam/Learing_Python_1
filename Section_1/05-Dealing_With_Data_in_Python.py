                                   # Data type #

# Data is a integral part of any program and app
  # In real life we have data like [name of a person , salary of employee , phone number.. price of a car]
# prgram is nothing but data and a set of Operations performed on that data
# Data stored in memory of a computer
# we use variables to refer to that memroy prtion "locaton"
# var not contain data but hold the address of that memory location
    # var us a bick name of memory location
    # var somtimes called "identifier"
# Data in real world can found in the form of:
  # numrical
  # string
  # True or false .. yes or not "Boolean"
# In python we've three catigeroes of data type:
    #[1]- Numarical
        # integer
        # float
        # Complex number
    #[2]- String
    #[3]- Boolean
